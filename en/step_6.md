What would you write in a birthday card to send to Code Club? It could be:
+ Your favourite thing about Code Club
+ A message about your fabulous Code Club leader
+ Details of what you want to make next with your coding skills

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
The first Code Club projects were written in English, but within a year they had been translated into Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, German, Norwegian, and Ukrainian. French, Greek, and Spanish translations quickly followed and now some of the Code Club projects have been translated into <span style="color: #0faeb0">**28 native languages**</span>. Thank you to our awesome translation community!

You can now type your new Code Club birthday message. Press **Enter** on your keyboard to start a new line. 

**Tip:** Don't worry if your message is a bit too big for the box as you can resize it later.

Click on the **Select** tool and eight circles will appear around your message. Use these circles to resize your message by clicking on them and dragging them within the white box.

Your message is ready, now you can add code to hide your message inside the piñata and make your message fall from the piñata after the tenth hit. 

--- task ---

Click on the **Code** tab then create a script to `hide`{:class="block3looks"} the message in the piñata when your project starts:

![The Message sprite icon.](images/message-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
hide
set size to (10) % // Change to 10 to start small
go to x: (0) y: (100) // Inside the piñata
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Create a new script to start when the `party`{:class="block3events"} message has been received. 

Add a `repeat`{:class="block3control"} loop to animate the message. The message will `change size`{:class="block3looks"} to grow and `change y`{:class="block3motion"} position to fall as it animates:

![The Message sprite icon.](images/message-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when I receive [party v]
show
repeat (20) // Change to 20
change size by (5) // Change to 5
change y by (-10) // Change to -10
```

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your project. Hit the piñata ten times to see the message fall.
