## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project. You might have ideas about what to add already! 

You could:

+ Use additional looks, sounds, or motion blocks to animate your message and treats further
+ Find images of your favourite treats and add them to the costumes for the **Treats** sprite
+ Increase the number of treats that fall from the piñata on each hit
+ Make your project easier or harder by changing the number of times you need to hit the piñata before it breaks

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Did you know you can add code to the backdrop too?

What happens to the backdrop when the piñata breaks? Which blocks would create this effect? 

[See the code](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/653771814/){:target="_blank"}

</div>
<div class="scratch-preview" style="margin-left: 15px;">

You could add code to make the message animate `forever`{:class="block3control"} when it is in position. Use `change size`{:class="block3looks"} and `change color effect`{:class="block3looks"} blocks so that it looks like the message is moving with the party beat: 

![The Message sprite icon.](images/message-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when I receive [party v]
show
repeat (20)
change size by (5)
change y by (-10)
end
+ forever
change size by (20) // Positive number to grow
change [color v] effect by (25) // Change colour
wait (0.5) seconds // Try different numbers to match your music
change size by (-20) // Negative number to shrink
```
