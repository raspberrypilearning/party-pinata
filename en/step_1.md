## Introduction

In this project, you will create a swinging piñata that releases treats when it is hit, and eventually breaks to reveal a Happy Birthday message.

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**piñata**</span> is often used to celebrate a birthday, new year, or festival. The shape and decorations of a piñata is designed to match the theme of the occasion and it is full of treats. The aim is to hit the piñata with a stick to break the piñata and release the treats.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Code Club**</span> is celebrating its 10th Birthday this year. Did you know that there are Code Clubs on six out of seven continents around the world? That’s a lot of coders making things with code! Do you think any other clubs will be doing this project right now?
