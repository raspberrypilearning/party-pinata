## Introduction

In this project, you will create a swinging piñata that releases treats when it is hit, and eventually breaks to reveal a birthday message.

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**piñata**</span> is often used to celebrate a birthday, new year, or festival. The shape and decorations of a piñata are designed to match the theme of the occasion. It's also full of treats. The aim is to hit the piñata with a stick to break the piñata and release the treats.

<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Use the stick to hit the piñata. 

What happens each time you hit the piñata? 

How many times do you need to hit the piñata for it to break?

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Code Club**</span> is celebrating its 10th birthday this year. Did you know that there are Code Clubs on **six out of seven continents** around the world? That’s a lot of coders making things with code! Do you think any other clubs will be doing this project right now?
